AI Visibility helps you choose questions to track and see whether AI answers mention your brand, cite your website, or include competitors.

## Set up your project

Add your website, then complete the setup shown on the AI visibility pages. Research fills missing project context and generates keywords; existing context and competitors are preserved. Generating keywords does not automatically run paid prompt research for each one.

## Research, explore, and track

- **Prompt Research:** analyze a keyword to find the questions people ask about it, with ChatGPT's answers and cited sources. Research currently covers US English. The questions come from DataForSEO's dataset, built mostly from Google "People also ask" questions; they are not logged ChatGPT prompts, and OpenSEO does not estimate how often they are asked in AI.
- **Prompt Explorer:** try one prompt in ChatGPT, or add Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity to compare answers and available citations. These are API model answers and can differ from consumer-site answers collected by tracking.
- **Prompt Tracking:** save exact questions under topics, select engines and a market, then run a check or enable daily, weekly, or monthly tracking. Editing a question's wording starts a new question, so earlier answers keep the wording they were collected for. ChatGPT and Gemini are selected by default; Google AI Overviews is also supported. Enabling tracking starts an initial check.
- **Competitors and Citations:** open these tabs in Prompt Tracking to review saved brand mentions, competitor appearances, and cited pages. Competitors come from shared Project context. Your brand counts as mentioned when its name or domain appears in an answer, and as cited when the answer links to your site. A failed check is not evidence that your brand was absent.

The trend chart includes manual and scheduled checks, using the latest finished run per day. Review and export saved results without using credits.

## Credits and cost

Prompt research costs about $0.25 in credits per keyword. Explorer charges actual usage for uncached answers. Tracking shows a cost estimate before a check or schedule is started and bills each check as it collects answers. Checks stop when your credits run out.

On hosted OpenSEO, Prompt Research and Prompt Explorer require the paid plan; prompt tracking only needs credits. Setup research uses available credits and is billed after completion.

Self-hosted users pay providers directly: set `DATAFORSEO_API_KEY` for research and answer collection, and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for setup research and generated prompt suggestions. See the [self-hosting guides](/docs/self-hosting).

## Use your assistant

Connect [OpenSEO MCP](/docs/mcp) to research prompts, configure tracking and read saved results from your assistant. For a one-off answer, ask the assistant to use `explore_prompt`; it defaults to ChatGPT.

Use [AI Prompt Research](/docs/skills/ai-prompt-research) to find questions before tracking, or [AI Visibility Audit](/docs/skills/ai-visibility-audit) to investigate improvements using answers and cited pages.
