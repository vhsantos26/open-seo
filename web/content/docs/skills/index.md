description: "Add OpenSEO Agent Skills to Claude Code, Codex, or another AI agent so it can run repeatable SEO workflows with live OpenSEO data."

OpenSEO Agent Skills let you hand repeatable SEO workflows to your AI agent.

Run a slash command when you need keyword research, clustering, competitor analysis, link prospecting, or project setup. The skill gives your agent the workflow instructions.

You stay in charge of strategy. Your agent uses OpenSEO data and the skill instructions to research the answer, then saves the result as a report in your project.

## Set up OpenSEO Agent Skills

On Claude Code, the [OpenSEO plugin](/docs/claude-code-plugin) installs MCP and every skill below in one step. On Codex CLI, the [OpenSEO plugin](/docs/codex-plugin) does the same. Use the manual steps here for other agents, or if you want to pick individual skills.

1. [Set up OpenSEO MCP](/docs/mcp).
2. [Set up OpenSEO Agent Skills](/docs/skills/setup).

MCP connects your agent to OpenSEO data. Skills tell your agent which SEO workflow to run.

## Start here

- [SEO Project Setup](/docs/skills/seo-project-setup): save your goals, positioning, competitors, and key pages to your project context, so every other skill reuses them.
- [SEO Coach](/docs/skills/seo-coach): choose the next workflow when you are new to SEO or unsure what to run first.

## Audit workflows

- [SEO Audit](/docs/skills/seo-audit): audit a site and understand its important problems, worthwhile improvements, and likely effects on traffic and the business.

## Research workflows

- [Keyword Research](/docs/skills/keyword-research): find keywords worth targeting and explain why they fit.
- [Keyword Clustering](/docs/skills/keyword-clustering): turn keyword lists into page groups, content priorities, and cannibalization checks.
- [Competitive Landscape](/docs/skills/competitive-landscape): map who is winning across a market and where your openings are.
- [Competitor Analysis](/docs/skills/competitor-analysis): analyze one competitor and turn the research into strategic takeaways.
- [Local SEO](/docs/skills/local-seo): audit a Google Business Profile, compare it to local competitors, and map Maps visibility around a location.

## Promotion workflows

- [Link Prospecting](/docs/skills/link-prospecting): find qualified outreach prospects and the angle that makes each one relevant.

## How the results reach you

- [SEO Report](/docs/skills/seo-report): the shared report-writing skill every workflow above delivers through. Your agent writes one self-contained HTML page and saves it to your project's Reports page, where anyone can read or print it.
