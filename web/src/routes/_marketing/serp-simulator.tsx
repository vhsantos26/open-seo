      "Keep the main topic near the start. This preview uses a 600-pixel desktop title and a two-line mobile title as guides. Letter widths vary, so character count alone does not tell you whether a title will fit.",

    question: "How long should a meta description be?",
    answer:
      "Put the most useful information first. This preview allows two lines on desktop and three on mobile, including the optional date. Actual snippets vary by query and screen size.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this guarantee what Google will show?",
    answer:
      "No. Google rewrites titles and descriptions regularly, especially when they don't match the query. This is an approximation; Google may choose different text, fonts, or layout.",
