  {
    question: "What does the spam score actually measure?",
    answer:
      "DataForSEO scores a link profile from 0 to 100 by looking at signals its index associates with low-quality sites — thin or duplicated content, link networks, unusual outbound link patterns. Higher means more of those signals. It is not a Google penalty score; Google publishes no such number.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I disavow the links you show?",
    answer:
      "Usually not. Google ignores most low-quality links on its own, and disavowing good links does real damage. Treat a high score as a reason to look, not as a to-do list.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many links does the free check show?",
    answer:
      "The 10 highest-spam referring domains, one link each. OpenSEO lets you filter the full backlink profile by spam score and see how much of the profile is affected.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where does the data come from?",
    answer:
      "DataForSEO's backlink index, cached for 24 hours per domain. It's the same data OpenSEO uses for backlink research.",
