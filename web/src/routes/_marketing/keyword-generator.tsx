    question: "How should I choose a starting topic?",

      "Use a short phrase that describes your product, service, or audience’s problem. If the results are too broad, try a more specific phrase; if there are no results, try a broader one.",

  {
    question: "What do missing metrics mean?",
    answer:
      "A dash means the provider has no value for that metric. It does not mean zero searches or zero competition. Volumes are estimates, and close variations can share the same estimate.",
  },
  {
    question: "How current are the results?",
    answer:
      "The tool uses DataForSEO’s keyword database, which is updated periodically. Results may be cached for up to 24 hours; they are not a real-time count of searches.",
