const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "Does domain age affect rankings?",
    answer:
      "Barely, on its own. Google has said age isn't a ranking factor. What correlates with age is everything a site accumulates over years — links, content, brand searches — and those do matter. Old and empty ranks worse than new and useful.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where does this data come from?",
    answer:
      "RDAP, the registry protocol that replaced WHOIS. The lookup goes straight to the registry that holds the domain, so there's no third-party data source and nothing to pay for.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does a domain show no registration data?",
    answer:
      "Some country-code TLDs don't publish RDAP records, and some registries hide dates. The tool says so for that row rather than guessing, and the other domains in your list still return.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the age the same as when the site launched?",
    answer:
      "No. It's when the domain was first registered. A domain can sit parked for years, or change hands and start over with new content. Check what it ranks for before drawing conclusions.",
  },
