    question: "Where does the backlink data come from?",
    answer:
      "Results come from DataForSEO's link index, the same data source that powers backlink research inside OpenSEO. The index is refreshed continuously, so counts can differ slightly from other tools that crawl the web on their own schedule.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many backlinks can I see for free?",
    answer:
      "The free checker shows a domain's summary metrics and its top 15 backlinks, one per referring domain, ranked by domain strength. Sign up for OpenSEO to page through the full list, see referring domains and anchors, filter out spam, and export the data.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I check a competitor's backlinks?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Enter your domain, a competitor's, or a site you're evaluating for outreach. Backlink data is public-web data, so no site ownership or verification is needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is domain rank?",
    answer:
      "Domain rank is a 0-100 score of a domain's link-profile strength, similar to domain authority metrics in other tools. Higher means the domain has more and stronger links pointing at it.",
