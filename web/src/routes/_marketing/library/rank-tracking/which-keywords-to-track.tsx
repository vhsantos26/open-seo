  {
    question: "How many keywords should I track for SEO?",
    answer:
      "Twenty to fifty for a typical small or mid-size site: the terms tied to pages that earn money, the striking-distance queries from Search Console, one or two brand terms as a control, and a couple of competitor terms. Track more only if someone will read the extra rows.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which keywords should I track first?",
    answer:
      "The ones Search Console already shows your site for at positions 4 to 20 with real impressions. They have demand, they are within reach of page one, and a position change will show up in clicks quickly enough to learn from.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I track keywords I already rank number one for?",
    answer:
      "A few. Brand terms belong in the tracker as an early-warning control, and a term where you rank near the top with a low click-through rate is worth tracking for its SERP features, since a feature above your result explains the missing clicks better than the position does.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it cost more to track more keywords?",
    answer:
      "Yes, in proportion. In OpenSEO the cost of a check is the number of keywords times the number of devices times the depth of results inspected, and scheduled checks run through a cheaper queue than one-off live checks. The app shows an estimate before you add keywords or start a run. On the hosted app, rank checks need the $10/month plan, which includes $10 of credits.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I re-pick the keywords?",
    answer:
      "Quarterly for the striking-distance bucket, since those queries shift as pages move. The money-page bucket changes only when the business does.",
