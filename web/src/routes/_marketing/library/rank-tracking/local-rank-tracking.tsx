    question:
      "Why do my local rankings look different on my phone and my colleague's?",
    answer:
      "Because you are standing in different places, or Google thinks you are. Proximity is one of the strongest signals for local queries, so two searchers a few kilometres apart routinely see different map packs. A tracker that checks from one point reports one of those views.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a local rank grid?",
    answer:
      "A set of searches run from points on a grid around a location, usually 3x3 or 5x5, reporting where a business ranks at each point. It shows how far a business's visibility reaches and where competitors take over, which a single rank check cannot.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many points should a local rank grid have?",
    answer:
      "Nine, spaced to cover the area you serve, is enough to see the shape. Use twenty-five when you are making a location decision. Beyond that you are paying for resolution you will not act on.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Should a service-area business set up a service area or an address on Google?",
    answer:
      "Use the settings that match how you serve customers. An eligible storefront that also visits or delivers to customers can show both an address and a service area. If customers do not visit your address, hide it and list your service area.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does OpenSEO do local rank tracking?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The MCP local rank grid measures Business Profile positions in Maps. Scheduled rank trackers measure organic website rankings from a chosen location. Both use credits. On the hosted app, scheduled and live rank-tracker checks require the $10/month plan, which includes $10 of credits.",
