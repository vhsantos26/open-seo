    question: "What SEO tasks can be automated?",
    answer:
      "Anything with a fixed input and output and no judgement: scheduled rank checks, Search Console pulls, site audits started on a fixed day, data exports. An agent can add a second layer, summarising and drafting from that data, as long as a person reads the result. Choosing what to track, what to build and what to tell a client stays with a person.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between SEO automation and an AI SEO agent?",
    answer:
      "Automation runs the same job on a schedule with no model involved, like a weekly rank check. An agent takes variable input and produces structured output using a language model, like reading the check and writing the summary. Many products sold as agents are a schedule plus a prompt; that is useful, but it still needs a reader.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I automate SEO reporting?",
    answer:
      "The data collection, yes: the tracker and Search Console pulls run on their own and use no credits to read. The draft, yes, with an agent and a saved prompt. The sentence that says what it means for the business should still be written or at least read by a person before it goes out.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does scheduled rank tracking cost in OpenSEO?",
    answer:
      "The app estimates before anything runs. As a reference, 25 keywords on mobile checking the top 40 results weekly comes to about $0.25 a month in credits; 100 keywords about a dollar. Scheduled checks go through a queue that is cheaper than one-off live checks. Rank checks on the hosted app need the $10/month plan.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I automate content production?",
    answer:
      "Not end to end. The strategy on [human in the loop content](/library/ai-agent-seo/human-in-the-loop-content) covers the split that works: a person writes the brief, the agent drafts, a person edits. Automating the brief or the edit produces content that reads like every other automated site.",
