// titles, GSC queries), so it is treated as hostile in both cases.
//
// The `sandbox` directive is what makes the open-in-a-tab case safe: a

// opaque origin anyway — no cookies, no localStorage, no same-origin access to
// the app.

 * reference); everything else stays restricted. The attribute must always be
 * present — an absent `sandbox` attribute is no sandbox at all — and
 * `allow-same-origin` is never added: it would hand the frame the app's cookies
