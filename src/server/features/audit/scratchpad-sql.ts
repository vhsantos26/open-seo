/**

 */

/**
 * `page_links` holds one row per crawled page — its internal link targets as
 * a JSON array of URL strings — instead of one row per edge. Rows written is
 * the DO SQLite billing unit, and link edges dominate an audit's writes.
 * WITHOUT ROWID keeps the TEXT primary key as the table itself, so a page
 * costs exactly one row written rather than a row plus an autoindex entry.
 *
 * The legacy per-edge `links` table is still declared (without its target
 * index, which nothing queries any more) so an audit that was mid-crawl when
 * the JSON layout shipped can still be finalized from the rows its earlier
 * chunks wrote. Delete the table and the UNION ALL branches in the queries
 * below after 2026-09-10: the 7-day cleanup alarm guarantees every such
 * object is finished or wiped by then.
